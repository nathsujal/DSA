My journey of learning DSA in Java and C++
- I know the basics of Java and C++.
- I also know the basics of some DSA concepts like Array, Linked List, Stack, Queues, Sorting algo, and Searching algo. I need to revise these concepts and learn what I left earlier.
- I will also share my journey on Twitter and LinkedIn.
